## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am Adhiraj Bhagawati. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at <br><a href="https://www.srmist.edu.in/">SRM Institute of Science and Technology</a>.</br>
### My Portfolio: https://reanadhiraj.now.sh/

## Stuff about me ðŸŽ®ðŸ•¹
I currently have experience in Game Development / Game Design & Mixed Reality using Unity and Unreal Engine and have made researched and completed several projects.
I also have proper experience in Marketing and Management, because just being a tech-head probably won't get me (very) high up the corporate ladder. In the process of having a bit of basic-intermediate experience in Machine Learning.

I want to focus on these skill-sets properly so I can have multiple opportunities in the future and be able to understand the corporate world from both a "Technical and Non-Technical" viewpoint.
And all of these in culmination will probably allow me (I hope so), to open my own Game Development Studio in the future. So, I am desperately trying to work towards my ideal self.

Thanks for reading this long introduction :D
